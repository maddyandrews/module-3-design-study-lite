    <h3>Precondition</h3>
    <h4>Learning</h4>
    <p>Children in the United States facing low food accessibility can, during school times, depend on 1-2 meals a day
        from
        a cafeteria, should their school have a free meal program. Outside of school hours, however (dinner time,
        weekends,
        school breaks, etc.), whether or not a youth has access to food is outside of their hands. In order to address
        low
        food accessibility for children, it is important to identify geographical regions within which children's food
        accessibility is low. From identifying these regions (and especially those with disproportionately low food
        accessibility for children, in particular), we can better understand how to resolve this issue. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Winnowing</h4>
    <p>In order to analyze discrepancies in food access for children across various regions, we can look at the CORGIS
        Dataset Project's Food Access CSV. This dataset comes from the US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research
        Service. It primarily contains data relating several demographics (low income households, children, seniors, and
        the general population) and how easily they are able to access food. This is quantified by the distance they are
        from any supermarket, or by the number of stores in their vicinity. In addition to accounting for family income,
        the data accounts for access to transportation by household. However, proximity to stores only shows how
        accessible food is physically, not financially. This dataset does not include factors such as family size, which
        can affect how income is able to be utilized by a household. It also doesn't account for those who are homeless.
        The data does not give insight to a family's financial situation, such as debts they may have. These can all
        impact food accessibility in ways greater than just being able to get to a grocery store. Especially for
        demographics such as children, being close to a supermarket is not the best measure for access to food, as they
        have neither financial nor physical means to get food by themselves there, nor should they be responsible for
        such. This ignores the possibility that parents and guardians are not providing them with food access as
        adequately as they should, or in the case they are unable to do so. However, distance to supermarkets does at
        least give insight into how easy it is to get to a food store from a transportation standpoint, which can still
        be valuable in understanding food access.

        This tabular dataset provides information detailing food accessibility by region, and also shows how different
        demographics fare in relation to proximity to food sources (i.e. supermarkets). The state and county fields are
        categorical properties that define what region a data point belongs to. The data set also contains quantitative
        fields, denoted as Low Access Numbers, describing how many people of a certain population live within certain
        distances to supermarkets (i.e within 0.5, 1, 10, and 20 miles). This includes both children specifically and
        the general population. Using the regional fields, as well as the low access number fields, can enable us to
        identify which geographical regions have the highest counts of children with low food access. This can also help
        to highlight patterns across certain states or counties where this disparity in food access is especially
        apparent.

    <h3>Core</h3>
    <h4>Discover</h4>
    <b>Task 1: Identify percentages regarding the amount of children in different regions that
        are far away from supermarkets</b>
    <p> This task should be pursued because it can allow viewers to compare and contrast regions with supermarket
        accessibility issues (specifically regarding children). In doing so, people can gain a deeper understanding of
        the causes of the issues at hand and, as a result, how to resolve them. In terms of what this visualization can
        allow people to learn about the data, it would help individuals learn the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What % of individuals in a region far away from supermarkets are children?</li>
        <li>What % of children in a region are far away from supermarkets?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In terms of where the task operates, we'd be looking at the specific regions (counties in different states of
        the US) and “Low Access Numbers”, which represents the number of people in a given county that are a certain
        distance away (in miles) from a supermarket. This “Low Access Numbers” category is broken into numerous fields
        separated by this distance, which ranges from half a mile to 20 miles. Additionally, these fields have data for
        just children and all individuals.</p>

    <p>Regarding when the task is performed, a visualization must be constructed first. After that point, viewers can
        discern what regions have the highest percent of low access children, and the greatest disparities of access
        between children and adults in a given region.</p>

    <p>As for who is executing the tasks, data analysts can interpret the results of the visualization. Then, they can
        pass their findings to a supervisor, who can communicate to an audience. This audience can hopefully use it to
        evaluate why food accessibility is a problem (or a greater problem) in certain regions and not others.</p>

    <br>

    <b>Task 2: Identify regions where the percent of children far away from supermarkets is
        notably greater than other regions.</b>
    <p>This task should be pursued so that regions in need of policy reform (regarding children's food accessibility,
        lunch programs in school, etc.) can be identified. After these regions are identified, the policy reform can
        actually be proposed and implemented by government officials and lawmakers.

    <p>This visual would shed light on US states and counties in need of policy reform. In particular, it would
        highlight individual regions (states and counties) in which there are notably high levels of food
        inaccessibility for children.</p>

    <p>This task operates in the same space as task 1. To recap, we're looking at specific regions (counties in
        different states of the US) and “Low Access Numbers” - counts of individuals (separated by age group) that are a
        certain distance away from a supermarket. This task builds off the findings of Task 1.</p>

    <p>Additionally, a visualization must be constructed prior to carrying out this task. Following the construction of
        the visual, though, viewers should be able to simply identify regions that might need to be prioritized for care
        and policy rework.</p>

    <p>This tool could be used directly by policy makers. These individuals are responsible for deciding which regions
        to prioritize for policy changes. Additionally, if the general public wanted to use the visualization and saw
        that a region for which they care is identified as a high priority, they could lobby for their government
        representatives to devote time and resources into resolving children food inaccessibility in a given region.</p>

    <h4>Design</h4>

    <br>
    <h4>Implement</h4>

    <p>The visual was designed modeling the low fidelity prototype. The darker the shade of blue, the greater the
        percentage of children (out of all individuals in a given county) that live at least 10 miles away from the
        nearest supermarket. The visual does, indeed, carry out task 1 and task 2. </p>
    <p>Task 1 is to “identify percentages regarding the amount of children in different regions that are far away from
        supermarkets.” The color of each county on the visual is based solely on the percentage of children that live a
        given distance away from the nearest supermarket. Counties in the US vary greatly by physical size. To better
        visualize small counties, we selected a distance threshold of 10 miles for this given distance. Additionally,
        when hovering over individual counties, the exact percentage is shown (unless the percentage calculated is 0 -
        in which case no percentage is shown).</p>
    <p>Task 2 is to “identify regions where the percentage of children far away from supermarkets is notably greater
        than other regions.” Viewers can clearly identify the darkest regions, and these darkest regions are those with
        the greatest percentages. In order to make the color variation more apparent, a stepped color range was
        implemented, where the next darker shade is reserved for percentages between 5 and 10 percent greater than that
        of the previous shade.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Deploy</h4>
    <b>Observations from Country POV:</b>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Task 1: Darker shaded counties reflect higher percents of children who have low food access, and lighter
            shaded ones reflect low percentages. This effectively allows viewers to compare county-to-county on the
            number of children there with low food access.</li>
        <li>Task 2: Counties in Florida, Alaska, Hawaii, and the Western US seemed to have the greatest percents</li>
        <li>Different regions (and states) of the United States have very different color makeups, illustrating
            differences in the percent of children with low supermarket access.</li>
        <li>Without already knowing the shape of different states, it can be difficult to discern the state borders.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Observations from State POV:
    <ul>
        <li>Task 1: Darker shaded counties reflect higher percents of children who have low food access, and lighter
            shaded ones reflect low percentages. This effectively allows viewers to compare county-to-county on the
            number of children there with low food access.</li>
        <li>Task 1: A lot of counties appear to be somewhere in the ~20% range and there are very few with ~40% or greater.</li>
        <li>Task 2: Differences in counties within a single state are easy to discern upon zooming into the map visual.</li>
        <li>Different counties in a single state have very different color makeups.</li>
        <li>After looking closely at the dataset, you can see that this is (sometimes) skewed by the number of children
            living 10 miles away from the nearest supermarket being very small.</li>
        <li>A lot of counties that have smaller populations to begin with may appear as outlines, which skews the
            perception of the data as a whole</li>
    </ul>
    Observations from County POV:
    <ul>
        <li>Looking at an individual county just shows the county with its given color, reflecting how many children there have low food access.</li>
        <li>Without comparing different counties to one another, this visual is not very helpful at this low of a level.</li>
        <li>Some counties appear to have very high percentages due to low sample size, making this even more difficult to discern.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Iterate</h4>
    <p>It seems that the supermarket metric isn't great for identifying low access to food by children. There aren't
        many people or children living far from grocery stores in many US counties, and outlier counties are very
        obvious when there is a small number of individuals living far from supermarkets. It would be helpful to pull in
        another dataset that more explicitly conveys food accessibility (to analyze the percentage of low income
        children that are able to get food from sources such as low/no-cost school lunches). This new dataset would also
        need to relate fields to counties. Instead of calculating the percent of low food access for children by
        supermarket proximity, we would use alternative fields from the new dataset to do so (also by county). This new
        task would re-analyze which counties and regions have the largest percentage of children with low food access
        using more relevant metrics.</p>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>

    <h4>Reflect Pt. 1</h4>
    <p></p>
    <br>

    <h4>Reflect Pt. 2</h4>
    <p>Creating this visualization stressed the importance of using the right tools for the right tasks. After creating
        our tasks for this visualization (identifying the percent of children in different regions that are far away
        from supermarkets + the regions where these values are noticeably larger than others), it was clear that
        creating
        a map visualization with different colored regions was the right approach. Because of this, it was also clear
        that Tableau was the tool to use. Had we not already been exposed to Tableau, however, and knew that it was
        suitable for our tasks, pre-module-3 us might have attempted to create this visual with a different tool, like
        D3.
        Recreating the map visualization in this way would have taken far longer and been totally unnecessary. In the
        future, if the right tool to create a certain kind of visualization doesn't immediately come to mind, we will be
        sure to research existing tools to ensure we don't recreate the wheel.
        <br><br>
        In terms of actually designing the visualization, it was extremely helpful to have multiple opinions and sets of
        eyes. The first go-around at creating this visualization had each percentage value mapped to a different color
        on
        the map. This made it difficult to discern variations between certain regions and, as a result, made the visual
        a
        less helpful tool for comparison. After one of us had the idea of separating color shades by 5% increments, the
        visualization became much more clear. Designing the visualization with a pair programming approach worked very
        well.
        It made the design and implementation processes much smoother, and helped the end product be better than it
        would
        have been otherwise (like with, for example, implementing steps to the color shades).
        <br><br>
        One thing that was difficult, though, when creating the visualization was figuring out if there was a best
        perspective (or zoom) from which to view the visualization. When the entire country can be viewed, pieces
        of the map could appear darker than they actually were, which implies greater percentages of children lacking
        access to supermarkets. This was not evident when the user was zoomed into a smaller region. We realized that
        this was due to the black outlines of county borders - particularly where there are a large number of counties
        in a relatively small space, like the east coast. This was an unforeseen bias from our visualization. In the
        future, it would be helpful to consider these things in advance (and research examples of map visuals used with
        the same tools/frameworks). Additional research could save time (or reduce unexpected delays) further down the
        line in the visualization-making process.
