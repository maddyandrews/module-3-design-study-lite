    <h3>Precondition</h3>
    <h4>Learning</h4>
    <p>Children in the United States facing low food accessibility can, during school times, depend on 1-2 meals a day
        from
        a cafeteria, should their school have a free meal program. Outside of school hours, however (dinner time,
        weekends,
        school breaks, etc.), whether or not a youth has access to food is outside of their hands. In order to address
        low
        food accessibility for children, it is important to identify geographical regions within which children's food
        accessibility is low. From identifying these regions (and especially those with disproportionately low food
        accessibility for children, in particular), we can better understand how to resolve this issue. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Winnowing</h4>
    <p>In order to analyze discrepancies in food access for children across various regions, we can look at the CORGIS
        Dataset Project's Food Access CSV. This dataset comes from the US Department of Agriculture's Economic Research
        Service. It primarily contains data relating several demographics (low income households, children, seniors, and
        the general population) and how easily they are able to access food. This is quantified by the distance they are
        from any supermarket, or by the number of stores in their vicinity. In addition to accounting for family income,
        the data accounts for access to transportation by household. However, proximity to stores only shows how
        accessible food is physically, not financially. This dataset does not include factors such as family size, which
        can affect how income is able to be utilized by a household. It also doesn't account for those who are homeless.
        The data does not give insight to a family's financial situation, such as debts they may have. These can all
        impact food accessibility in ways greater than just being able to get to a grocery store. Especially for
        demographics such as children, being close to a supermarket is not the best measure for access to food, as they
        have neither financial nor physical means to get food by themselves there, nor should they be responsible for
        such. This ignores the possibility that parents and guardians are not providing them with food access as
        adequately as they should, or in the case they are unable to do so. However, distance to supermarkets does at
        least give insight into how easy it is to get to a food store from a transportation standpoint, which can still
        be valuable in understanding food access.

        This tabular dataset provides information detailing food accessibility by region, and also shows how different
        demographics fare in relation to proximity to food sources (i.e. supermarkets). The state and county fields are
        categorical properties that define what region a data point belongs to. The data set also contains quantitative
        fields, denoted as Low Access Numbers, describing how many people of a certain population live within certain
        distances to supermarkets (i.e within 0.5, 1, 10, and 20 miles). This includes both children specifically and
        the general population. Using the regional fields, as well as the low access number fields, can enable us to
        identify which geographical regions have the highest counts of children with low food access. This can also help
        to highlight patterns across certain states or counties where this disparity in food access is especially
        apparent.

    <h3>Core</h3>
    <h4>Discover</h4>
    <b>Task 1: Identify percentages regarding the amount of children in different regions that
        are far away from supermarkets</b>
    <p> This task should be pursued because it can allow viewers to compare and contrast regions with supermarket
        accessibility issues (specifically regarding children). In doing so, people can gain a deeper understanding of
        the causes of the issues at hand and, as a result, how to resolve them. In terms of what this visualization can
        allow people to learn about the data, it would help individuals learn the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What % of individuals in a region far away from supermarkets are children?</li>
        <li>What % of children in a region are far away from supermarkets?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In terms of where the task operates, we'd be looking at the specific regions (counties in different states of
        the US) and “Low Access Numbers”, which represents the number of people in a given county that are a certain
        distance away (in miles) from a supermarket. This “Low Access Numbers” category is broken into numerous fields
        separated by this distance, which ranges from half a mile to 20 miles. Additionally, these fields have data for
        just children and all individuals.</p>

    <p>Regarding when the task is performed, a visualization must be constructed first. After that point, viewers can
        discern what regions have the highest percent of low access children, and the greatest disparities of access
        between children and adults in a given region.</p>

    <p>As for who is executing the tasks, data analysts can interpret the results of the visualization. Then, they can
        pass their findings to a supervisor, who can communicate to an audience. This audience can hopefully use it to
        evaluate why food accessibility is a problem (or a greater problem) in certain regions and not others.</p>

    <br>

    <b>Task 2: Identify regions where the percent of children far away from supermarkets is
        notably greater than other regions.</b>
    <p>This task should be pursued so that regions in need of policy reform (regarding children's food accessibility,
        lunch programs in school, etc.) can be identified. After these regions are identified, the policy reform can
        actually be proposed and implemented by government officials and lawmakers.

    <p>This visual would shed light on US states and counties in need of policy reform. In particular, it would
        highlight individual regions (states and counties) in which there are notably high levels of food
        inaccessibility for children.</p>

    <p>This task operates in the same space as task 1. To recap, we're looking at specific regions (counties in
        different states of the US) and “Low Access Numbers” - counts of individuals (separated by age group) that are a
        certain distance away from a supermarket. This task builds off the findings of Task 1.</p>

    <p>Additionally, a visualization must be constructed prior to carrying out this task. Following the construction of
        the visual, though, viewers should be able to simply identify regions that might need to be prioritized for care
        and policy rework.</p>

    <p>This tool could be used directly by policy makers. These individuals are responsible for deciding which regions
        to prioritize for policy changes. Additionally, if the general public wanted to use the visualization and saw
        that a region for which they care is identified as a high priority, they could lobby for their government
        representatives to devote time and resources into resolving children food inaccessibility in a given region.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Design</h4>
    <img class="image" src="design.png">
    <br>
    <h4>Implement</h4>
    <p>The visual was designed modeling the low fidelity prototype. The darker the shade of blue, the greater the
        percentage of children (out of all individuals in a given county) that live at least 10 miles away from the
        nearest supermarket. The visual does, indeed, carry out task 1 and task 2. </p>
    <p>Task 1 is to “identify percentages regarding the amount of children in different regions that are far away from
        supermarkets.” The color of each county on the visual is based solely on the percentage of children that live a
        given distance away from the nearest supermarket. Counties in the US vary greatly by physical size. To better
        visualize small counties, we selected a distance threshold of 10 miles for this given distance. Additionally,
        when hovering over individual counties, the exact percentage is shown (unless the percentage calculated is 0 -
        in which case no percentage is shown).</p>
    <p>Task 2 is to “identify regions where the percentage of children far away from supermarkets is notably greater
        than other regions.” Viewers can clearly identify the darkest regions, and these darkest regions are those with
        the greatest percentages. In order to make the color variation more apparent, a stepped color range was
        implemented, where the next darker shade is reserved for percentages between 5 and 10 percent greater than that
        of the previous shade.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Deploy</h4>
    <h4>Iterate</h4>
    <p>It seems that the supermarket metric isn't great for identifying low access to food by children. There aren't
        many people or children living far from grocery stores in many US counties, and outlier counties are very
        obvious when there is a small number of individuals living far from supermarkets. It would be helpful to pull in
        another dataset that more explicitly conveys food accessibility (to analyze the percentage of low income
        children that are able to get food from sources such as low/no-cost school lunches). This new dataset would also
        need to relate fields to counties. Instead of calculating the percent of low food access for children by
        supermarket proximity, we would use alternative fields from the new dataset to do so (also by county). This new
        task would re-analyze which counties and regions have the largest percentage of children with low food access
        using more relevant metrics.</p>
