    <p>Children in the United States facing low food accessibility can, during school times, depend on 1-2 meals a day from
        a cafeteria, should their school have a free meal program. Outside of school hours, however (dinner time, weekends,
        school breaks, etc.), whether or not a youth has access to food is outside of their hands. In order to address low
        food accessibility for children, it is important to identify geographical regions within which childrenâ€™s food
        accessibility is low. From identifying these regions (and especially those with disproportionately low food
        accessibility for children, in particular), we can better understand how to resolve this issue. </p>
